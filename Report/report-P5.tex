\section{Preamble}
Files will be submitted per instructions to pilot, and all work will be available on github at: \url{https://github.com/NickWer/CEG3900_P5} in two days.

\section{Task 1}
Deliverables: See devDocs.pdf and userDocs.pdf, see images 1-4 for screenshots.

Status report: I believe my user docs are sufficient for this game. I believe my dev docs, while they are not super in depth, provide an adequate high level view of the application's classes. They do not address specific implementation details however.

Experience: The user docs were not bad. The game is kind of fun but the difficulty is low and then becomes somewhat impractically difficult after a certain point. Very hard to play while the phone is plugged in. The dev docs were kind of a pain, but realistically it's not too terrible to understand all the source code.

\section{Task 2}
Deliverables: See screenshots 5-8. My MS Azure account is linked to my wright state email address, werle.3@wright.edu

Status Report: The application works as expected. Uploads and recalls images without hiccup.

Experience Report: Building the APK was very easy. Honestly registering to MS Azure was harder, because of a glitch with wright state's single sign on. I had to go incognito to get it to work. Other than that, and trying to find my account key, it was not a terrible experience. A promising platform, for sure, with a generous trial offer.
